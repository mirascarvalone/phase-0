Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository on GitHub, go to the top right corner where there is a plus sign and click "new repository," then give it a name and description. To clone the repository, copy the link on the right under HTTPS clone URL, and type into your terminal "git clone [link]".
Describe what open source means.
Open source means that the code behind a program is publicly available, so others can view and edit it if they want.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open source sounds cool, and like there is a lot of possiblity for creative ways to change things. It makes me feel neither nervous nor protective.
Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are important to determine what we can do with others' code, so we can "license" it out so that people can do certain things with it, while the owner still holds the copyright.
What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The repetition of adding, commiting, pushing, and pulling is helpful. I don't think I had any "aha" moments, but it's becoming more second nature now. I struggled with the repeated pushing and pulling from my local machine vs. GitHub and remembering when to do both. I also confused myself a few times by being in the wrong folder when starting a branch.
