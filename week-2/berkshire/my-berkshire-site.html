<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was interesting to see our HTML knowledge "come to life," and I like that you can see the impact of your changes so easily by refreshing the page. This website is a little weird looking though, so it felt kind of strange trying to emulate it so closely.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  We did not spend much time researching semantic elements as the page was very simple to create.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  We didn't format much, but it was unclear how close we were supposed to stick to the original Berkshire Hathaway website. To avoid formatting, we kept the colors as default (instead of changing them to blue), and didn't spend too much time worrying about the allignment since we will learn CSS next week!
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  It is easy to see the results of your work quickly and iterate on that. However, it seems a little inflexible and somewhat boring to use (ie. there's not a lot of logic involved). And since we weren't styling much in this exercise, the webpage looks terrible and old. But I'm sure we will work on that in the future.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  It's useful to always indent your code, and remember that any tag you open has to be closed. It was fairly easy to google some concepts that I did not understand. Also, the concept of nesting is useful, so that I always remember which tags are inside each other.
