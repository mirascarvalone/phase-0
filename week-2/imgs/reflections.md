#What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
  The six phases of web design are information gathering (think about the purpose, goals, target audience of your website), planning (creating a site map), design (creating prototypes of what your website will look like), development (actually building the site), testing and delivery (test functionality, for example across different browsers/devices), and maintenance (updating content and information over time).
#What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
  My site's goal is to introduce myself to other developers and potential employers by providing information about my work history, interests, blog, and projects.
#What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  My target audience is interested in learning more about me as either a potential collaborator or employee. They will want to know a brief bit about me (so I will have an "about me" section), and also want to learn about my experiences with programming (so there will be a "projects" section). There will also be a section with contact information if they are interested in getting in touch.
#What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  I envision that the user will first learn more about me through my "about me" page, and then navigate to my portfolio/blog. If they like what they see, then the last step would be to contact me using my contact page.
#What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  User experience and design should be considered on a one-off basis rather than trying to apply general principals to every website or situation. The design of a website should take into account what that exact website is trying to accomplish, and tailor that accordingly based on what we'd like users to do in those situations. That may not carry over from other websites or situations, so it's important to assess each individually.
#What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
  UX design involves evaluating how users feel using a set of tools (such as a website). This includes usability, efficiency, and usefulness of a website. UX design is especially valuable these days because so many people use hte internet, and there has been a shift in focus from client centered design to user centered design. Furthermore, as people start to access the internet using different browsers and devices, UX becomes increasingly important to cater to the different experiences people have online.
#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  I find editing the markdown text so that it looks nice tedious.
