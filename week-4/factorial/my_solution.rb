# Factorial

# I worked on this challenge with Dana.


# Your Solution Below
def factorial(number)
  if number == 0
    return 1
  elsif number == 1
    return 1
  else
    number*factorial(number-1)
  end
end


# Psuedocode
# start with low number, work up --> condition that zero returns 1
# factorial(1) = 1 --> may need special condition
# 0 - 1
# 1 - 1
# 2 - 2
# 3 - 6
# 4 - 24
# 5 - 120

# n*n-1*n-2 repeated until n=1

# while n > 1
#   n*n-1
#   n-=1


# 2! = 2*1!
# 3! = 3*2!
# 4! = 4*3!
# -- if x= 0 then output = 1
#   otherwise x*factorial(x-1)
# increment each integer by 1
# x! = x*(x-1)!

# The factorial of a number is the product of all integers from 1 up to that number. For example:

# factorial(5) == 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 == 120
# The factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.


    # while number > 1
    #   return number*(number-1)
    #   number-=1
    # end
