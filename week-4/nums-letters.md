#2.1: Summary

#What does puts do?
  Puts prints out the value of your ruby program on its own line, but does not store the evaluated code.
#What is an integer? What is a float?
  An integer is a whole number that can be negative or positive, but does not have decimal points. A float can have decimal points.
#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
  Float division produces an answer without decimal points (since the inputs have no decimal points). Ruby will round down in this case, whereas integer division produces a more "exact" answer with decimal points, since the inputs have decimal points.

Here are my Ruby codes:

Hours in a year:
```ruby
puts 24*365
```

Minutes in a decade:
```ruby
puts 60*24*365*10
