  <h1>Week 1 Learnings</h1>
  <h2>Version Control and GitHub</h2>
  <h3>October 25, 2015</h3>
</header>

<p>This week I learned a lot more about the command line, and how to use Git and GitHub to manage my workflow and collaborate with others. There was a lot of emphasis on version control and why we would need to be mindful of version control while we were coding. I have used Git and GitHub before in my previous role as a data analyst, so I had some familiarity with these concepts. We use version control so that we can capture snapshots of our work at different times, in case we may need to go back and edit our previous work. This also allows us to collaborate better with others since we can locate exactly when we made certain changes and see how that interacts with otherâ€™s work. We also allow others to comment on our changes and make sure they are correct before we finalize them.</p>

<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  I tend to use <p> and <article> often to deal with blocks of text, which come up often in website creation. I'm also trying to get better at using <section> often to break up certain elements, and I also like using <header> and <footer> if there's a clear group of elements that will go on the top or bottom of my page.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  Elements are laid out on a page according to their tags - the browser uses the tags to determine how to display particuar elements. In terms of thinking about the order that the browser uses to display elements, it's useful to think in terms of nesting. The browser interprets the outer most elements first and then looks within those to continue determining how to format what's in the HTML.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  In this challenge we learned about ways to save and reuse code snippets, which seems very useful. It definitely makes sense to research some of the shortcuts that already exist - for example, we used the html tab shortcut in this exercise and it was very useful. One thing I would note is that for now, as a beginner, I do find it useful to continually type out a lot of the same things over and over to help remember them, so I may try to rely less on snippets for now so that I can make sure that I can use typing out the same things as a way to learn through memorization. But I defintiely can see how this would be a huge time saver in the future.-->
